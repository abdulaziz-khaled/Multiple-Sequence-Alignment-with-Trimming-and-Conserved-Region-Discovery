# Introduction
Thyroperoxidase (TPO) is a key enzyme involved in thyroid hormone biosynthesis, making its gene sequence an important target for molecular and bioinformatics studies. Due to natural sequence variations across species and isoforms, identifying reliable conserved regions within the TPO gene is essential for downstream applications such as primer design, comparative genomics, and functional analysis.

In this study, a complete workflow was established to process and refine TPO gene sequence data through multiple sequence alignment (MSA), sequence trimming, and conserved region discovery. Collected TPO sequences from various organisms were aligned using widely adopted alignment algorithms to reveal evolutionary conserved motifs. Subsequent trimming steps were applied to remove low-quality or misaligned regions, ensuring high-confidence alignment blocks suitable for further analysis.

The resulting conserved regions provide a robust foundation for future experimental and computational applications, including primer development, structural prediction, gene-based diagnostic assays, and reconstruction of phylogenetic trees to infer evolutionary relationships. This workflow demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating MSA, trimming, and conservation analysis to extract meaningful biological insights from sequence datasets.
